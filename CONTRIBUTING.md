# Contributing to CodeChat

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **CodeChat** (p2p-comms)! This project aims to provide a lightweight, secure, and serverless communication tool.

## Ways to Contribute

| Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Bug Reports** | Identifies issues with the P2P connection or UI glitches. |
| **Feature Requests** | Suggests new modules like file sharing or group rooms. |
| **Code Contributions** | Submits Pull Requests to improve the core logic. |
| **Documentation** | Improves the README or adds comments to complex JS logic. |

## Development Workflow

To maintain a clean codebase, please follow these steps when contributing:

1. **Fork & Clone:** Create your own copy of the repository and clone it locally.
2. **Branching:** Create a descriptive branch name (e.g., `fix/connection-timeout`).
3. **Local Testing:** Test by opening `index.html` in two separate browser windows to simulate a P2P link.
4. **Committing:** Keep commit messages concise and descriptive.
5. **Pull Request:** Submit your PR against the `main` branch.

## Technical Standards

* **No External Dependencies:** Keep the project limited to vanilla JS and PeerJS.
* **UI Consistency:** Follow the "glassmorphism" CSS theme (blur, transparency, and dark borders).
* **P2P Integrity:** Ensure new features do not require a centralized database.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug that is **not** a security vulnerability, please open an issue in the GitHub "Issues" tab. Provide:
* A clear description of the bug.
* Steps to reproduce the error.
* Your browser version (e.g., Chrome 120, Firefox 121).
